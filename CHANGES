CHANGES 4/29/91:

Calls to shutdown() now include the second argument, a 2.
A useless call to fcntl() was removed.
The call to accept() in make_new_conn was changed so that the 3rd
parameter passed contains a pointer to the size of the structure,
not a 0.

In sample.c: (of little importance)
A lot of people couldn't compile it because they had non-backward-
compatible /usr/include/inet/in.h's. I changed the address-printing
bit of code for the WHO command to a call to inet_ntoa

None of the above should change your code even a little bit. Just re-compile
with the new interface.c.
